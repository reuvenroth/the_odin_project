#stackoverflow Question

After going through the [codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/courses/ruby-beginner-en-0i8v1/0/1?curriculum_id=5059f8619189a5000201fbcb) ruby section "A Night at the Movies", I wanted to extend the case-statement to allow input again. By the end my code was:

    movies = {
      living_torah: 5,
      ushpizin: 5
    }

    def input #method for gets.chomp
        gets.chomp.downcase
    end

    puts "To exit please type 'Quit' or 'Exit'"
    puts 'Please type "add", "display", "update" or "delete".'
    choice = input

    case choice
        when "add"
            puts "Movie Title please:"
            title = input.to_sym
            puts "How would you rate it?"
            rating = input.to_i
            if movies[title].nil?
                movies[title] = rating
                puts "Movie: '#{title.to_s.capitalize}' added with a Rating of # {rating}."
            else
                puts "That Movie already exists. Try updating it."
            end
        when "update"
            puts "Movie Title please:"
            title = input.to_sym
            if movies[title].nil?
                puts "That Title doesn't exist. Please 'add' it."
            else
                puts "Your Movie was found. How would you rate it?"
                rating = input.to_i
                movies[title] = rating
                puts "Movie: '#{title.to_s.capitalize}' updated with a Rating of #{rating}."
            end
        when "display"
            movies.each { |movie, rating| puts "#{movie}: #{rating}" }
        when "delete"
            puts "Which Movie would you like to delete?"
            title = input.to_sym
            if movies[title].nil?
                puts "That Title doesn't exist. Please 'add' it."
            else
                movies.delete(title)
                puts "The Movie '#{title.to_s.capitalize}' has been deleted."
            end
        when "exit", "quit"
            exit
        else
            puts "Invalid choice."
    end

I added the "exit" case independently of the exercise hoping to C.R.U.D. until explicitly exiting the program. How would I change the code to be able to restart/reuse the case-statement indefinitely?
(Also, is there a simpler/shorter way to produce the same results as this case-statment?)
